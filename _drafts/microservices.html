<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Small, and focused on doing one thing well</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">less<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cohesive code </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Robert C. Martin’s definition of “Single Responsibility Principle”(SRP) which states “Gather those things which changes for same reason, and separate those things which change for different reasons”. Micro services take this same approach to independent services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Service boundaries are focussed on business boundaries making code to live for the functionality and thus avoiding the temptation for making service too large.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How small is small?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> - getting idea from number of lines of code is problematic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> - as size decrease the benefits around interdependence increase but so does complexity of <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>many having parts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Autonomous</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Micro service is a separate entity.</span></p>
