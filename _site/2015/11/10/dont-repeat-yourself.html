    <blockquote>"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous , authoritative representation within a system."</p></blockquote>
<p>We all are aware the above stated famous DRY principle, yet we keep on making mistakes, keep on repeating ourselves. In this blog I will be writing about the why duplication happens and what can be done to avoid it. Most of the time you will find that duplication happens due to following reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>Developers feels that there is no choice and they are forced to do duplication in other words duplication is <strong>Imposed</strong> on them.</li>
<li>Duplication sometimes comes as a result of bad design and developer might not be aware about it i.e. <strong>Inadvertent Duplication</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Imposed Duplication</strong></p>
<p>In every developer's life there comes a situation when you think that there is no way around but you have to duplicate for your requirements. But by sticking to some of the following techniques one can avoid it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid comments</strong>, this may sound opposite to what you have been doing so long, but this is a fact that we are taught that code should have a lots of comments, but unfortunately nobody has told us why code needs comments , only a bad code requires them. Comments become out of date sooner than code, and untrustworthy comments are worse than no comments.</li>
<li><strong>Always write documentation and then write code.</strong> If something changes append documentation first then change the code. Both always contain representation of same knowledge. And documentation can be used for writing tests or something else thus can be used to save a lot of time.</li>
<li>Under pressure we tends to take shortcut, avoid standard protocols and become <strong>Impatient</strong> which will eventually lead to duplication.</li>
<li>When multiple people work on a project then entire set of functionality inadvertently duplicated and such duplication can go undetected for very long period of time, which makes them hardest of all, this is called <strong>Interdeveloper Duplication</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Inadvertent Duplication</strong></p>
<p>This type of duplication usually happens due to bad design at first place. Scenarios like a multiple classes having same attributes i.e <strong>unnormalised data </strong>is created and when there is any update requirement for such attributes then one has to make sure that update happens in all classes. This kind of situations can be simply avoided by creating a good design which will eventually never create any unnormalised data.</p>
<p><strong>Impatient Duplication</strong></p>
<p>In almost every project , there comes a situation when due to time pressures ,most of us tend to take shortcuts , like just copy from somewhere and modify according to requirements, or just hardcode values etc. All these things attracts even best of us, only advice for such situations is a discipline and willingness to spend time up front to save pain later. When you are tempted to make such mistake always remember "<strong>Shortcuts make for longer delays"</strong>. This type of duplication is very easy to detect and handle.</p>
<p><strong>Interdeveloper Duplication</strong></p>
<p>Since this is the hardest of all type of duplications to detect, which makes us think that it will require utmost care to avoid or to detect. But for this also there is a simple practice by following it we can easily avoid it and even it persist then will be detected at an early stage. <strong>Active communication among developers </strong>that's the only thing which can stop it, and this can be achieved by setting up discussion forms, newsgroups to exchange ideas and code reviews. All we should try to foster an environment where it's easy to find and reuse existing implementations rather building again from scratch.</p>
<p>I hope you learned what I tried to teach and try to adapt at least some of them in your daily routine. That's all, <strong>happy hacking!</strong></p>
